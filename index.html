					<p>  
						Do you want to participate in such a landscape Hanfu Festival?
						</br>
						</br>
						"The moonlight of autumn night is better than that of spring night, and thousands of miles of frost days are quiet and lonely". The autumn wind rises gradually and the layers of forests are dyed. In November, Xuedou mountain scenic spot has also entered a romantic season. When the "classical beauty" in the painting collides with the beautiful scenery of Xuedou mountain, what kind of visual feast will it present for you? On November 6, "the first Xuedou mountain · landscape Hanfu Festival" will be officially launched in Xikou ancient town and Xuedou mountain scenic spot in Ningbo. From November 6 to November 28, tourists can enjoy Xuedou mountain without tickets as long as they wear Hanfu.</br>
						Ningbo Xikou, a place with historical and cultural beauty and natural landscape, is a "national key scenic spot" and a "national 5A tourist area". The integration of the ancient town and Xuedou mountain brings the beauty of landscape and humanities. In history, Xuedou mountain was the "eight pole watch" of song Renzong's sleepwalking, and was specially given the "famous mountain for dreams". It also has a profound historical and cultural heritage. In the golden autumn, Xikou Xuedou mountain, known as the National Forest Park, has a pleasant autumn color. Fresh negative oxygen ions breathe in the lungs. Layers of trees on the mountain, such as autumn screens, block impetuosity in the city. Tourists wear Hanfu to play here, which is both healthy and eye-friendly.
						The "Xuedou mountain · landscape Hanfu Festival" will arrange Hanfu theme performances, dance performances, martial arts theme performances and other contents every weekend in November. Rich and colorful activities will complement the landscape beauty of Xuedou mountain scenic spot.
						</br>
						</br>
						In the first chapter of "touching the landscape with broad sleeves" to be opened on the 6th, we will participate in an immersive landscape Hanfu culture theme exhibition and linger in the picturesque landscape, so that tourists can see the beautiful shadow of Hanfu Xianjia; Passing by sanyintan, the maple leaves are high and low, alternating with density. The Hanfu and the evergreen green in the mountains form a color collision; Stepping on the Miao high platform, the whole body is surrounded by clouds and fog. The white clothes float with the wind with the action of swinging arms. Even if they are not silk, they also have the beauty of Qianqian; Walk in the mountains, listen to birds and insects, breathe and breathe in the embrace of forest oxygen bar, and unlock the joy sealed in the heart.
						The follow-up activities are arranged as follows: "string songs, silk and bamboo, the sound of mountains and rivers". The performers will perform Chinese style music between the mountains and rivers, and complete a harmonizing sound of zither and Harp with the gurgling mountains and streams; "Dancing sleeves flying in the mountains and rivers", excellent dancers come to the mountains and rivers of Xuedou mountain, dancing sleeves flying in the mountains and rivers; "Landscape swordsman line", through a swordsman theme exhibition to awaken your sleeping martial arts dream... During the whole activity, you can also take a slow train and slowly enjoy the scenery along the way; Sit on the cableway hidden in the mountains and see the mottled leaves all over the mountain.
						Activity introduction
						</br>
						</br>
						Activity time: November 6-28, 2021
						</br>
						</br>
						Preferential activities: as long as you wear Chinese clothes to enter the park, you only need to pay 30 yuan for Xuedou mountain bus, and you can enjoy the preferential policy of free tickets in Xikou Xuedou mountain scenic spot (original price: 120 yuan / person, 30 yuan / person)</br>

						</br>
						May 27-29, 2022
						</br>					
						Hynes Convention Center
						</br>
						Boston, MA
						</br>					
						Anime Convention
						</br>						
						Organized by New England Anime Society</b>
						</br>
						</br>

						Hello, it's been a while. It's hard to believe that we haven't seen each other since 2019. The past few years have brought on difficult challenges and plenty of anxiety, but we've thankfully been able to move forward to finally present you with Anime Boston 2022! There's a lot to catch up on.
						</br>
						Though our last two conventions were canceled, the world moved on. We've had to continuously adapt to changes as the situation developed. We knew that if we made an announcement every time something changed, the end result would be confusion. So, we decided to wait until the dust settled in order to give a comprehensive and more detailed update on what is happening with Anime Boston and what to expect for 2022. Now, we are finally on more stable footing to make such an announcement.
						</br>
						To start, we want to let you know that planning for Anime Boston 2022 is scheduled as any other convention year would allow. However, there will be some changes and new policies in place. Let's break it down into pieces.
						</br>
						</br>
						</br>
						<b>Vaccination and Mask Requirements</b>
						</br>
						</br>
						Anime Boston 2022 will have a COVID-19 vaccination and mask requirement for all in attendance, including but not limited to artists, exhibitors, staff, and attendees. More specific details on these policies will be announced closer to the convention date. These policies may change as we continue to observe the status of the pandemic and receive instructions from the city and state.
						</br>
						</br>
						</br>
						<b>Pre-registered Members</b>
						</br>
						</br>
						As a reminder, we will be honoring all pre-registered members who have allowed us to rollover their registrations from Anime Boston 2020. All pre-registered members from 2020 should receive a confirmation email after our systems go live. Please allow one month for this process to complete. If you are not sure about the status of your registration, please contact our registration customer service team. There will no longer be a Merch Store coupon to cover the difference in registration prices from 2020 because...
						</br>
						</br>
						</br>
						<b>Membership Price Increase</b>
						</br>
						</br>
						The New England Anime Society (NEAS) is a 501(c)3 non-profit corporation. As such, our revenue to expense ratio has always been thin. We have always priced memberships at the amount we believe we need to break even for that year. Any excess assets are directed toward the operation of the corporation and future conventions. No members of Anime Boston or NEAS staff or executives receive any pay or financial compensation, ever.
						</br>				
						We have always prided ourselves on keeping membership costs as low as possible. This still holds true today, but the unfortunate reality is that the world and expenses are not the same they were three years ago. Whenever we increase our membership prices, we also acknowledge that we may price ourselves out of some people's budgets, which is why we are bringing back…
						</br>
						</br>
						</br>
						<b>Single Day Memberships</b>
						</br>
						</br>
						That's right! Single day memberships are back. We will be offering single day memberships for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Additionally, we will be introducing a family package that includes two adult and two youth memberships.
						</br>
						</br>
						</br>
						<b>Other Status Updates</b>
						</br>
						</br>Artists' Alley: We plan to offer the same spaces to the same artists who would have attended AB2020. Artists on the AB2020 waitlist will be contacted if there is space available.
						</br>Dealers' Room: We will reach out to vendors and sponsors to maintain their booth space from AB2020 and work with waitlisted exhibitors if space becomes available.
						Hotels: Scheduled to go live in November.
						</br>
						Pre-Registrations: Scheduled to go live in November.
						Panelists: All panelists must reapply for 2022.</br>
						Press: All press must reapply for 2022.</br>
						Community Row: All must reapply for 2022.</br>
						Staff Applications: Currently open.
						</br>
						</br>
						If you are not one of the above listed groups and you have a question regarding an event, please contact us using the contact form on our website. We will respond as soon as possible.
						</br>
						</br>
						Thank you all, and we will see you soon!

					</div>
					<p></br><b>1000 Broadway, Nashville, TN 37203</b></br></br>
						MTAC invites you to the Lolita and J-fashion Tea Party, where guests will be able to enjoy sweets, tea, and conversation with old and new friends. Photographers will be available to catch you in your best, and there will be door prizes and “best dressed” competitions for Lolita and other J-fashion styles.
					</br>
					</br>
						This event is $20 at the door of the Tea Party, and is subject to a dress code that is semi-formal (no jeans, no mainstream or contemporary streetwear of any other culture besides Japanese). No cosplays or large props, “maid” outfits, or Kigurumis will be allowed. All Lolita coordinates must be complete and formal—no casual/soft or ero Lolita or “Alice” cosplays. Some styles that are underground street fashion may not be allowed because of their casual or inappropriate nature. Due to the high demand, dress code will be strictly enforced, so please, if you have any questions about your outfit, email photos of your completed outfit and a description of the style you wish to portray and any other questions you may have to sheena.patterson@mtac.net.
					</br>
					</br>
						Thank you, and we hope to see you at the MTAC Lolita and J-Fashion Tea Party.
